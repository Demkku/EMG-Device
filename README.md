## W19

On monday the case is printed, also
project software created and completed as it is very simple. 

With the completetion of SW with Aruino IDE and receiving of the mesuring electrodes on the last minute
PROJECT COMPLETED!!!

## W18

Testing software created. Extensive testing and simulation done. 
See baseband testing report and oscilloscope pictures.

## W17

The remaining components soldered and measurements taken to the case.
During the soldering, some missing traces noticed, but fixed with jump wires.
Traces missing on the layout.

EKG electrodes ordered from Medkit.

Modeling of the case started with blender.
Also, modeling of the measuring table started with blender.

## W16

Midterm meeting

Later on the week, components received and first soldered.

## W15

The idea maybe changed to a heart rate sensor, which can be measured with the same circuit. 
Will be tested when components received, probably on W16 or 17

V2 board Milled with Success!!!

Components ordered from Mouser.

Design for an enclosure started, will be 3D printed.

## W14

Layout V1 started and completed:

BOM completed.

V1 board milled:

The board failed with board width at 0.4mm and uneven board at milling machine.
As a result wire width doubled to 0.8mm wherever possible.

## W13

After brainstorming requrements set:
[add picture here]

Kicad schematics started:

Kicad schematics done after a lot of reading about op amps:

## W12

The repositery and site created

## Start of the project:

Introductory report, EMG-Device

521159P Principles of Digital Fabrication 
DIGIFAB10 

The idea is to build a device that can measure EMG signal. EMG signals are created when muscles are used, and nerve impulses are sent. Impulses create a potential difference in the order of 1-10mV which is amplified, filtered and read with an Arduino. To meet course requirements an enclosure will be 3D printed and something laser cut. We arrived at the idea of an EMG device as a combination interest to the subject of bio signals, the challenge and courses about op amps are running in parallel with this course, so we can use in practice what we have learned. 

Other project that we thought of was an Arduino tank that could locate WIFI signal sources, but this would have been very software heavy, and because we are EE students, we wanted to put emphasis on hardware. Also locating sources turns out to be very hard. Our back up plan is an EKG device, which instead of 3 measuring lanes, uses only one.
